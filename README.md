Conclusion

In this analysis, we performed a comprehensive exploration and modeling process for credit card fraud detection using an imbalanced dataset. The steps included:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: We began by loading and exploring the dataset, visualizing class imbalance, and performing necessary preprocessing steps.

Correlation Analysis: By investigating the correlations between features, we gained insights into how features interact with each other. This helped in identifying potential redundancies and understanding feature relationships.

Handling Imbalanced Data: We applied techniques such as undersampling and oversampling to address the class imbalance. This was crucial in ensuring that our models could better learn from the minority class.

Model Training and Evaluation: We trained and evaluated various classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and RandomForest. We assessed model performance using metrics such as confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC-AUC scores, and ROC curves.

Key Findings

Feature Correlations: Our correlation analysis revealed important relationships between features. This understanding can guide feature selection and engineering in future analyses.

Model Performance: The RandomForestClassifier demonstrated high accuracy in detecting fraud, showing that it is a strong candidate for deployment. The ROC-AUC scores and ROC curves provided insights into each modelâ€™s performance, particularly in distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Impact of Imbalance Handling: Techniques for balancing the dataset were essential in improving model performance and ensuring that the minority class (fraudulent transactions) was adequately represented in the training process.
